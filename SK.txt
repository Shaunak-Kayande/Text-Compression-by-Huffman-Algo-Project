Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem
(/ˌɛmɪˈnɛm/; sometimes stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, songwriter, 
record producer, record executive, film producer, and actor. He is consistently 
cited as one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time. In addition 
to his solo career, Eminem was a member of the hip hop group D12. He is also known 
for his collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9"; the two are
 collectively known as Bad Meets Evil. 
After his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), 
Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved
mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP and its lead single "My 
Name Is".[2] His next two releases The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem
Show (2002) were worldwide successes and were both nominated for the Grammy Award
for Album of the Year. As a result of being the leading figure in a form of black
music, Eminem was subject to comparisons to Elvis Presley at the time.[3] Encore 
was released in 2004, which faced heavy criticism by fans and critics for its 
lacklustre quality.[4] Eminem went on hiatus after touring in 2005 partly due 
to a prescription drug addiction.[5] He released Relapse in 2009 and Recovery the 
following year, which both won Grammy Awards for Best Rap Album. Recovery was the 
best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, making it Eminem's second album, after The 
Eminem Show in 2002, to be the best-selling album worldwide. Eminem's eighth album 
The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013) also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album; it 
expanded his record for the most wins in the category.[6]
